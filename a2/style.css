STYLE.CSS 
===========================================================

For this project, I created a CSS file that gives the media player a nature-inspired theme. 
I focused on designing a calming and visually soothing interface, using soft, gentle colors that evoke a sense of relaxation.
The palette primarily features sage green and light mint tones, which create a fresh and peaceful atmosphere.
To further reinforce the natural theme, I incorporated an image that includes elements such as mountains, flowers, and trees,
adding depth and visual interest while connecting the media player to a tranquil, outdoor environment. 
Overall, the design aims to create an immersive and relaxing experience for users.

-----------------------------------------------------------
THEME
-----------------------------------------------------------

Colours: 
- Sage green (#9caf88) as the dominant background color, 
  representing calmness and balance.
- Light mint (#dff5e1) as a secondary accent, ensuring 
  contrast and freshness.
- Darker greens (#4a5d23) for text, borders, and accents 
  for natural readability.

Typography:
I chose to use the imported fonts "REM" and "Tuffy" from Google Fonts for my headings and body text.
I wanted the simple, natural typography to align with the overall "organic" theme of my design.

Nature Elements:
I chose a calming nature landscape image inside the media player to reinforce the "relax/study" mood,
featuring mountains, trees, and flowers to suggest peace, growth, and balance—ideal for a study environment. 
The bright colors, including greens, blues, and purples, were selected to naturally reduce stress and create a sense of freshness,
while butterflies add a touch of lightness and movement, symbolising calm transitions and focus.
Overall, the scenery ties into the green background theme, making the design feel consistent and immersive.

/* -------------------- BODY ----------------------------
For the body background, I chose a combination of sage green and light mint. 
I used a gradient to blend these colors smoothly, creating a soft and natural feeling that feels calming to the eye. 
I wanted the background to evoke a sense of tranquility and connect with the overall nature-inspired theme of the project, 
making the interface feel fresh and peaceful.

/* -------------------- HEADER --------------------------
I made the header bold and large to ensure it immediately welcomes the user and draws their attention in a clear and friendly way.
To complement this, I chose a dark green shade for the text, which not only keeps it highly readable but also harmonises with the
overall natural theme of the design.

/* -------------------- MAIN ----------------------------
Media Player Container:
I added a light green background with rounded corners to give the media player a soft and inviting appearance.
To subtly define its space on the page, I included a thin border that separates it gently without drawing too much attention. 
I also kept the layout simple and uncluttered, ensuring that the user’s focus remains on the content itself rather than being
distracted by overly complex design elements.

/* -------------------- IMAGE IN MEDIA PLAYER ---------------------
I chose a nature landscape over abstract art or plain shapes because it directly communicates calmness and serenity. 
While abstract designs can look modern, they don’t always convey a specific feeling, whereas the landscape instantly creates
a relaxing mood. Plain shapes or flat colors might feel too empty and lack the warmth that natural elements bring.
By including mountains, trees, and flowers, the image provides a sense of openness and fresh air,
aligning perfectly with the idea of studying in a stress-free, peaceful environment.
I also incorporated subtle visual details, such as butterflies and greenery, to add points of interest without 
overwhelming the user, unlike busy abstract visuals that can feel distracting.

/* -------------------- CONTROLS -------------------------
I used clean, minimal icons to keep the design uncluttered and visually simple.
I also added spacing between the buttons to make them easy to click and create a comfortable, user-friendly experience. 
To ensure the buttons felt integrated with the rest of the design, I chose matching green tones, making them blend seamlessly
with the overall nature-inspired theme.
