          1) What was the first thing you paid attention to when interacting
          with the experience?
        </h2>
        <p>
          The first thing I paid attention to was the immersive landing page
          that immediately drew me in with the bold, rounded display typography.
          At the same time, the background music started playing and I felt like
          it really complimented the visuals.

          2) Spend two minutes with the experience and create a list of each of
          your discrete actions.
        </h2>
        <p>
          In the first two minutes, I scrolled down from the landing page to
          explore the introduction, clicked into the first chapter, and kept
          going over interactive models and graphics to view more information
          throughout the first two minutes. I moved between sections, read the
          text while listening to the background music, and occasionally stopped
          to look at the images before continuing.

          3) What part of the experience did you spend the most time engaging
          with?
        </h2>
        <p>
          I spent the most time exploring all three chapters, paying attention
          to the models and pictures, reading the texts, and watching the
          architect ‘Frank Gehry’ talk about the design process. The mix of
          visuals, written content, and spoken insights kept me engaged
          throughout.

          4) What was the most common action in your two minute interaction with
          the experience?
        </h2>
        <p>
          The most common action I did was probably scrolling through the
          content and different chapters, alternating with clicks to expand the
          visuals or view interactive models.

          5) What is your impression of the intended primary goal of the
          interactive experience?
        </h2>
        <p>
          The primary goal seems to be to share the creative journey of Frank
          Gehry’s Walt Disney Concert Hall, highlighting his design process
          through sketches, models, interviews, and immersive visuals.

          6) How does the interactive experience communicate this primary goal?
        </h2>
        <p>
          It creates a narrative flow that encourages learning and exploration
          through the use of archival material, engaging visuals, background
          music, and a chapter-based structure.

          7) What is your impression of how the experience should be interacted
          with over time? (For how long and how many different times)
        </h2>
        <p>
          It seems to be made for both short visits and in-depth curiosity,
          allowing users to revisit particular chapters or take their time
          diving deeper into the overall story.

          8) How does the interactive experience communicate how it should be
          interacted with over time?
        </h2>
        <p>
          The variety of multimedia components, highlight sections, and
          straightforward chapter navigation allows users to go at their own
          pace and go back to the material as needed.

          9) What other media forms (digital or otherwise) does the experience
          reference?
        </h2>
        <p>
          It merges elements of physical exhibitions, 3D digital modeling, and
          recorded performances, similar to how hybrid museum experiences
          combine in-person and online content.

        </h2>
        <p>
          It recommends interacting with the experience as a component of a more
          comprehensive educational process. Taking time to listen, observe, and
          connect the digital materials with their physical and cultural
          context.

          11) What does this reference/s communicate to you about how you should
          feel when engaging with your research experience?
        </h2>
        <p>
          It encourages a sense of reflection, curiosity, and appreciation for
          creative expression, similar to attending a concert or visiting a
          museum.

          12) What is the most frustrating part of the interaction to you and
          what makes that part frustrating?
        </h2>
        <p>
          To be honest, I didn’t find any part of the interaction frustrating.
          Everything felt smooth, intuitive, and easy to navigate, which made
          the experience enjoyable from start to finish.

          13) What is the most satisfying part of the interaction to you and
          what makes that part satisfying?
        </h2>
        <p>
          The most satisfying part was how the music, images, and interactive
          elements came together to provide a deep, multi-sensory understanding
          of Frank Gehry's artistic process.
